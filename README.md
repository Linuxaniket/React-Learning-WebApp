## 🤔 Why I Built This

While learning React, I realized the best way to master something is to **teach it**. This project is my effort to consolidate core React concepts into an easy-to-use, interactive format — useful for both learning and revision.

It also reflects my skills in:
- React architecture
- Tailwind theming and UI
- Code formatting and readability
- Clean project structuring
- Hosting and CI/CD
